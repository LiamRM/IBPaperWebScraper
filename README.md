# IB-Paper-Web-Scraper
## How it works
In high school, I found myself spending a large amount of time sifting through the IBDocuments website to download test papers (for practice). This python script is intended to automatically generate a list of links to the PDFs of IB math papers via web scraping. The user specifies the range of years and the the level (Higher Level or Standard Level) and links are obtained by scraping the IBDocuments.com website, which is then saved to a CSV file. This list of links can then be opened via the OpenList Google Chrome extension. 

## What I learned
- Web scraping using the Beautiful Soup module
- CSV file parsing
